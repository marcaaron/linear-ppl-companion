# Linear PPL Archive App

## Workout Progress Data Visualization Project

A simple companion app to my Linear-PPL workout tracking app. This will display a log of all workout days at the current weight attempted coded by color. Clicking once on an exercise will pull up all previous records of the type of workout day. Clicking again will show only those specific exercises side by side. And once more will bring up a graph charting progress. Built in React. Graphs courtesy of Chart.JS.
